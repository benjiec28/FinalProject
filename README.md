# School System

## Author : Benjamin Elli Cunanan

This is the final project for the course "Introduction to Programming".
This project represents a school system similar to those in real life. 
In it, we are able to verify, define and modify details from the different classes present this system, such as the address, the department, the students info, the assignment info and the course info.
This system is able to perform certain methods such as the following :
    -Validate Different fields (such as a "Postal Code" and a "Department Name").
    -Extract this information in order to have specifics on certain classes.
        E.g. Getting a students id, name, gender, address, department and registered courses.
    -Calculate students averages where each score has a certain weight (meaning how much it's worth in the final score).
    -Drop or register students in a certain course.
    -etc.
Thanks to this, we are able to manage a replica of a school system in a single program.
